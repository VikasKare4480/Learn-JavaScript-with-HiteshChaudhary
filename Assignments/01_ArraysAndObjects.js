// ### Arrays:

// 1. Create an array named `numbers` with integers from 1 to 5. Add 6 to the end, remove the first element, and print the final array.

// 2. Given an array, filter out even numbers, create a new array with the filtered results, and print it.

// 3. Given an array of names, create a new array with the length of each name and print it.

// 4. Create an array of numbers, use `reduce` to calculate their sum, and print the result.

// 5. Given an array of strings, sort them alphabetically and print the sorted array.

// ### Objects:

// 6. Create an object named `person` with `name`, `age`, and `city`. Assign values, and print the object.

// 7. Add an `occupation` property, update the `age`, and print the modified `person` object.

// 8. Create a `car` object with `model`, `year`, and a nested `engine` object. Print the `car` object.

// 9. Iterate over an object's properties using a loop and print them.

// 10. Create two objects, write a function to compare their equality, and test it.
